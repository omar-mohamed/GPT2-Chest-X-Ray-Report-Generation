# GPT2-Chest-X-Ray-Report-Generation (CDGPT2)
This is the implementation of the CDGPT2 model mentioned in our paper 'Automated Radiology Report Generation using Conditioned Transformers'.

Paper link [here](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.imu.2021.100557).

We automatically generate full radiology reports given chest X-ray images from the IU-X-Ray dataset by conditioning a pre-trained GPT2 model on the visual and semantic features of the image.

## Installation & Usage
*The project was tested on a virtual environment of python 3.7, pip 23.2.1, and MacOS*
- pip install -r full_requirements.txt (or pip install -r requirements.txt if there are errors because of using a different operating system, as requirements.txt only contains the main dependencies and pip will fetch the compatible sub-dependencies, but it will be slower)
- nlg-eval --setup
- python get_iu_xray.py (to download the dataset)
- python train.py
